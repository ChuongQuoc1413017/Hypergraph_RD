Previous results have shown that these higher-order interactions can profoundly modify the dynamics of contagion processes, resulting in bistability, hysteresis, and explosive transitions. In this paper, we present and analyze a hyperdegree-based mean-field description of the dynamics of the susceptibleâ€“infectedâ€“susceptible model on hypergraphs, i.e., networks with higher-order interactions, and illustrate its applicability with the example of a hypergraph where contagion is mediated by both links (pairwise interactions) and triangles (three-way interactions). We consider various models for the organization of link and triangle structures and different mechanisms of higher-order contagion and healing. We find that explosive transitions can be suppressed by heterogeneity in the link degree distribution when links and triangles are chosen independently or when link and triangle connections are positively correlated when compared to the uncorrelated case. We verify these results with microscopic simulations of the contagion process and with analytic predictions derived from the mean-field model. Our results show that the structure of higher-order interactions can have important effects on contagion processes on hypergraphs.}",

  abstract  = "AbstractRecent progress in applying complex network theory to
               problems in quantum information has resulted in a beneficial
               cross-over. Complex network methods have successfully been
               applied to transport and entanglement models while information
               physics is setting the stage for a theory of complex systems
               with quantum information-inspired methods. Novel quantum induced
               effects have been predicted in random graphs---where edges
               represent entangled links---and quantum computer algorithms have
               been proposed to offer enhancement for several network problems.
               Here we review the results at the cutting edge, pinpointing the
               similarities and the differences found at the intersection of
               these two fields.",
